Online Approval Committee Elections
------
IJCAI, 2022

Assume k candidates need to be selected. The candidates appear over time. Each time one
appears, it must be immediately selected or rejectedâ€”a decision that is made by a group of
individuals through voting. Assume the voters use approval ballots, i.e., for each candidate they
only specify whether they consider it acceptable or not. This setting can be seen as a voting variant
of choosing k secretaries. Our contribution is twofold. (1) We assess to what extent the committees
that are computed online can proportionally represent the voters. (2) If a prior probability over
candidate approvals is available, we show how to compute committees with maximal expected
score.

Classifiaction Aggregation Without Unanimity
------
Mathemathical Social Sciences, 2024

Given a set of object and categories, individuals are asked to give a classification (mapping of objects into categories) and we need to aggregate these classifications. Most litterature on this problem proved an Arrow like theorem for some variants of this or studied the fuzzy implementation, we proved here a Wilson-like theorem (replacing unanimity by citizen sovereignety which states that any object can be mapped to any category by the aggregating rule).

Online algorithms for Participatory Budgeting
------
With Jan Maly

Deciding whether to fund a proposed project from a limited budget or not is one of the most
common and crucial problems in basically any organisation. The rise of participatory budgeting
(PB) over the last 30 years [Dias et al.(2019)] has demonstrated that such funding decision
can be made in a democratic and participatory way. So far, PB has mostly been used on
the level of municipalities, but recently it has also been applied in smaller organisations, for
example in Lithuanian schools1 . Currently, PB is usually organized as a yearly one shot event
in which the whole budget for the year is decided upon in one election. However, in many
cases, funding decisions have to be made continuously throughout the year whenever a new
project is proposed.
