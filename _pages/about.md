I am a PhD student in computer science at [LAMSADE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr) under the supervision of Remzi Sanver, Olivier Cailloux and Ali Ozkes. My topics of interest are mostly in [computational social choice](https://www.comsocseminar.org), but I aslo work on online optimization, decision under uncertainty among other fields of computer science. Outside of research, I have a severe addicition to sports, especially rugby, running and climbing (non-exhaustive list of course).
