I am a PhD student in computer science at LAMSADE under the supervision of Remzi Sanver, Olivier Cailloux and Ali Ozkes. My topics of interest are mostly in computationnal social choice, but I aslo work on online optimization, decision under uncertainty among other fields of computer science. Outside of research, I have a severe addicition to sports, especially rugby, running and climbing (non-exhaustive list of course).
