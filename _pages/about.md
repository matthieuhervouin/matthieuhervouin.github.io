I am a PhD student in computer science at [LAMSADE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr) under the supervision of Remzi Sanver, Olivier Cailloux and Ali Ozkes. 

My topics of interest lie mostly in [computational social choice](https://www.comsocseminar.org), but I aslo work on online optimization, decision under uncertainty among other fields of computer science. 

I have a high interest in popularizing research in social choice which I plan to allocate more time to when I am done with the PhD.
