Given a set of object and categories, individuals are asked to give a classification (mapping of objects into categories) and we need to aggregate these classifications. Most litterature on this problem proved an Arrow like theorem for some variants of this or studied the fuzzy implementation, we proved here a Wilson-like theorem (replacing unanimity by citizen sovereignety which states that any object can be mapped to any category by the aggregating rule).
