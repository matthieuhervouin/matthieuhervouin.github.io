Assume k candidates need to be selected. The candidates appear over time. Each time one
appears, it must be immediately selected or rejected—a decision that is made by a group of
individuals through voting. Assume the voters use approval ballots, i.e., for each candidate they
only specify whether they consider it acceptable or not. This setting can be seen as a voting variant
of choosing k secretaries. Our contribution is twofold. (1) We assess to what extent the committees
that are computed online can proportionally represent the voters. (2) If a prior probability over
candidate approvals is available, we show how to compute committees with maximal expected
score.
